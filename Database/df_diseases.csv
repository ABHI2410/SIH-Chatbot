People with anorexia use extreme efforts to control their weight and shape, which often significantly interferes with their health and life activities.', 'When you have anorexia, you excessively limit calories or use other methods to lose weight, such as excessive exercise, using laxatives or diet aids, or vomiting after eating.

Why it occurs is still unknown. To understand how Ebstein anomaly affects your heart, it helps to know a little about how the heart works to supply your body with blood.', 'Your heart is made up of four chambers. The two upper chambers (atria) receive blood. The two lower chambers (ventricles) pump blood.', 'Four valves open and close to let blood flow in one direction through the heart.

Blood then flows through the tricuspid valve and into the right ventricle, which pumps the blood to your lungs to receive oxygen. On the other side of your heart, oxygen-rich blood from your lungs flows into the left atrium, through the mitral valve and into the left ventricle, which then pumps the blood to the rest of your body.', ""In Ebstein anomaly, the tricuspid valve sits lower than normal in the right ventricle.

In this condition, pressure on sensitive points in your muscles (trigger points) causes pain in the muscle and sometimes in seemingly unrelated parts of your body.

When an animal has a tapeworm infection, it has tapeworm larvae in its muscle tissue. If you eat raw or undercooked meat from an infected animal, you ingest the larvae, which then develop into adult tapeworms in your intestines.\n\nAdult tapeworms can measure more than 80 feet (25 meters) long and can survive as long as 30 years in a host. Some tapeworms attach themselves to the walls of the intestines, where they cause irritation or mild inflammation, while others may pass through to your stool and exit your body. \n']","['Factors that may put you at greater risk of tapeworm infection include:', 'Poor hygiene. Infrequent washing and bathing increases the risk of accidental transfer of contaminated matter to your mouth.', 'Exposure to livestock. This is especially problematic in areas where human and animal feces are not disposed of properly.', 'Traveling to developing countries. Infection occurs more frequently in areas with poor sanitation practices.', 'Eating raw or undercooked meats. Improper cooking may fail to kill tapeworm eggs and larvae contained in contaminated pork or beef.', 'Living in endemic areas. In certain parts of the world, exposure to tapeworm eggs is more likely. For instance, your risk of coming into contact with eggs of the pork tapeworm (Taenia solium) is greater in areas of Latin America, China, sub-Saharan Africa or Southeast Asia where free-range pigs may be more common.']","['Tapeworm infection is caused by ingesting food or water contaminated with tapeworm eggs or larvae. If you ingest certain tapeworm eggs, they can migrate outside your intestines and form larval cysts in body tissues and organs (invasive infection). If you ingest tapeworm larvae, however, they develop into adult tapeworms in your intestines (intestinal infection).', 'An adult tapeworm consists of a head, neck and chain of segments called proglottids. When you have an intestinal tapeworm infection, the tapeworm head adheres to the intestinal wall, and the proglottids grow and produce eggs. Adult tapeworms can live for up to 30 years in a host.', 'Intestinal tapeworm infections are usually mild, with only one or two adult tapeworms.
